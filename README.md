# TrackerYoga
Bend, cross, spread, twist... TrackerYoga is a set of synthetic diffusion MRI data for testing tractography algorithms.

Below shows ground truth tracts. Synthetic data is generated using MITK Diffusion (https://www.mitk.org/wiki/MitkDiffusion) [[1]](#1).

Noisy versions of images are generated by adding random signal with complex-Gaussian distribution (with variances of 2, 4 and 8 for b-values of 1000, 2000 and 3000 s/mm2 respectively.)

FODs are computed using the compartment model approach explained in [[2]](#2). FODs with both spherical harmonic orders of 8 and 16 are provided. (No processing is done before the computation of FODs.) Below shows example FODs for the 30 degree crossing.
